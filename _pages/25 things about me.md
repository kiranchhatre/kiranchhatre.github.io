1.  I believe that the philosophy of personal science and self-experimentation
    can make a huge difference in our lives. I have been a vegan since a year,
    and I feel it has brought tremendous change in my well being and overall
    health.

2.  I love reading self-help books and following life coaches. The two books
    which had utmost impact on me are “The mind Set” by Prof. Carol S.Dweck and
    “Mini-Habits” by Stephen Guise.

3.  I am very proud of my time management skills and enthusiasm I bring along
    with me. Most of the people forget that we have limited time, and I have
    sheet of check boxes with number of weeks left in my life (based on average
    life expectancy of Indians), it freaks out my friends!

4.  My parents’ life journey is inspiring and extremely close to my heart. All the hardships they 
    have faced, fundamentally framed my mind set and I believe that true lasting
    success is a result of lifetime’s hard work. There is no substitute.

5.  I have been an ardent follower of Jose Mourinho (Manager of Manchester
    United Football Club). Unlike others, I don’t support a club. duh..!

6.  I am a pro FIFA player! I play on xbox with my friends in the USA and compete
    with strangers on online seasons.

7.  I love watching TED talks. Right from the silly videos on how to tie your
    shoe laces correctly, to understanding the science of consciousness, I enjoy
    all spheres of topics during my munch time.

8.  I believe in intermittent fasting. Although it is a religious custom for my
    mom to fast on particular days of a week, the reality is, it is backed by
    science.

9.  In my short career, I have worked with a Principal Scientist, several
    professors and heads of Research and Development at top companies, all of
    them have told me that I have a good attitude and I am a polite person.

10. I aspire to be a certified sky-diver and CEO of a company one day \m/.
