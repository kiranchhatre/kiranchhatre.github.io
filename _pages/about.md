I am a masterâ€™s student in Computational Engineering, with specialization in
Machine learning at Ruhr University Bochum (RUB). I am currently doing my master
thesis in Large Scale Machine learning in the Theory of Machine Learning group
at Neuroinformatic department, RUB.

I believe in the Growth mindset ***becoming is better than being***, coined by Carol S. Dweck, Professor of Psychology at Standord University. I am a self drivern guy pushing myself for new experiences beyond my comfort zone. I have deep love for mathematics, enjoy
understanding the physics and programming computational algorithms.
