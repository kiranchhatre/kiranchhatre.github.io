I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Aided Conception in Mechanical Engineering at RWTH Aachen University. I am currently employed as a Research Affiliate at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), California, USA. Being a part of Sustainable Energy Systems Group at LBNL, my main focus is multifidelity Bayesian optimization of a large-scale multi-agent transportation simulation.
