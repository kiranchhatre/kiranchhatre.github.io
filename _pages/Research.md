## Datascience

>   **Master Thesis** at Theory of Machine Learning group at Ruhr- Universität Bochum, Germany. (*Apr 2018 –present*)

-   I am developing of a Novel algorithm with application of Budget Maintenance
    strategy on the Adaptive Coordinate Frequency - Coordinate Descent method
    for Support Vector Machines.
-   It is a non-convex optimization problem, and I am working the stopping
    criterion.
-   Please see the abstract here
-   The programming is done in ***C++ and Python***.

## Others

>   **Project work:** at the **Chair of Computing in Engineering,** Ruhr-Universität Bochum,Germany.(*Oct 2016 –Feb 2017*) 

-   Three Poisson (serial) solvers, viz. Jacobi, Gauss Seidel and Successive Over Relaxation methods were parallelized in OpenMP, OpenMPI.
-   Please see the presentation here.
-   The programming was done in ***C++, OpenMP and OpenMPI.***

>   **Project Work:** at the **Chair of Computing in Engineering** at Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Germany. (*Dec 2016 –Jun 2017*)

-   Developed a Java software package for the linear simulation of spatial framework structures with the help of the finite element method.
-   Also developed a GUI to visualize the results.
-   Please have a look at the output
-   The programming was done in ***JAVA*** on Eclipse.

>   **Bachelor Thesis** at National Aerospace Labs, Bangalore – India (May 2012 –Aug 2012)

-   Developed a novel Multiscale Model to predict the effective composite properties of Fiber-reinforced polymers with Carbon Nano-inclusions.
-   Please see the report here and presentation here
-   The ***C programming*** was done in ***Matlab***. Also, used ***MSC-Nastran*** for pre-processing.
