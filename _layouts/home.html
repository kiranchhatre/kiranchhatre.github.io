<p>I am a master's student in Computational Engineering, with specialization in Machine learning at Ruhr University Bochum (RUB). I am currently doing my master thesis in Large Scale Machine learning in the Theory of Machine Learning group at Neuroinformatic department, RUB.</p>
<p>I believe in the "Growth mindset", <strong>becoming is better than being</strong>, coined by Carol S. Dweck, Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. I am a self-driven person pushing myself for new experiences beyond my comfort zone. I have a deep love for mathematics, I enjoy understanding the physics and programming computational algorithms.</p>
